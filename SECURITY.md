# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Lido team appreciates your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the [Lido Bug Bounty program on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lido).

The Immunefi platform allows the Lido team to better track and respond to vulnerabilities, while also providing an opportunity for researchers to be rewarded for their findings.

Please DO NOT file a public issue on GitHub or disclose the vulnerability publicly in any way before it has been addressed by the Lido core contributors.

## Scope

For details on what is considered in scope for the bug bounty program, please refer to the Lido Bug Bounty page on Immunefi.

## Process

1. Submit your report through the Immunefi platform.
2. The Lido team will assess the report and may ask for additional information or clarification.
3. Once validated, the team will work on a fix and coordinate the release process.
4. After the fix has been deployed, the team will publish a security advisory and acknowledge your contribution (if you wish to be credited).

Thank you for helping keep Lido and its users safe!
